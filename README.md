The project "mentalFitnessTracker" was developed during an artificial intelligence (AI) internship under the IBM SkillsBuild program organized by AICTE and Edunet. The project aims to create a mental fitness tracker application.Having resources to track and maintain one's mental fitness is critical as mental health is a critical component of total wellbeing. Using AI and machine learning techniques, I formulated a mental fitness tracker during Programme of 6 weeks. With a personalised and data-driven approach to stress management and self-care, the mental fitness tracker seeks to enable people to take control of their mental health. I've added my completion certificate, solution, and presentation here.
